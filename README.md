# MyReads Project

This is the project nÂ°5 of the Google Udacity Front end nanodegree : My Reads - A Book Tracking App

## Project Goals

The goal is to learn React, and all his subtlety.

## How to try

-  Clone the repository (or download the zip file)
-  Go to the folder and Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
-  Start the development server with `npm start`

## Dependencies
-  None, all code is already included.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
